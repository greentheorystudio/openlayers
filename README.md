# OpenLayers

[OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) is a high-performance, feature-packed library for creating interactive maps on the web. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source on any web page. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the [BSD 2-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).

## Getting Started

Install the [`@greentheorystudio/ol` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@greentheorystudio/ol):

```
npm install @greentheorystudio/ol
```

Import just what you need for your application:

```js
import Map from 'ol/Map';
import View from 'ol/View';
import TileLayer from 'ol/layer/Tile';
import XYZ from 'ol/source/XYZ';

new Map({
  target: 'map',
  layers: [
    new TileLayer({
      source: new XYZ({
        url: 'https://{a-c}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'
      })
    })
  ],
  view: new View({
    center: [0, 0],
    zoom: 2
  })
});
```

See the following examples for more detail on bundling OpenLayers with your application:

 * Using [Rollup](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-rollup)
 * Using [Webpack](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-webpack)
 * Using [Parcel](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-parcel)
 * Using [Browserify](https://github.com/openlayers/ol-browserify)

## Supported Browsers

OpenLayers runs on all modern browsers that support [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) and [ECMAScript 5](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/). This includes Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. For older browsers and platforms like Internet Explorer (down to version 9) and Android 4.x, [polyfills](http://polyfill.io) for `requestAnimationFrame` and `Element.prototype.classList` are required, and using the KML format requires a polyfill for `URL`.
